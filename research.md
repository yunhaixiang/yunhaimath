My research interests lie mainly in number theory, and in particular arithmetic geometry. I especially like topics of a cohomological flavor. More specifically, some topics I'm interested in are:

- Rational points
- Ramification theory
- \\(\mathbb A^1\\)-enumerative geometry
- Moduli spaces and stacks
- Galois representations

Outside my main interests, I'm somewhat curious about homotopy type theory.
