My interests mainly lie in arithmetic geometry and number theory. Specifically, I'm curious about

- Brauer groups
- Ramification theory
- \\(\mathbb A^1\\)-enumerative geometry
- Moduli spaces of arithmetic interests

Outside my research interests, I have some side interests in the foundations of mathematics.
