My research interests lie mainly in number theory, and in particular arithmetic geometry. I especially like topics of a cohomological flavor. More specifically, some topics I'm interested in are:

- Rational points
- Galois representations
- \\(\mathbb A^1\\)-enumerative geometry
- Ramification theory
- Moduli spaces and stacks
