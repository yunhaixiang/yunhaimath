My research interests mainly lie in number theory and arithmetic geometry. More specifically, some topics that I especially want to understand are the following

- Cohomology theories in arithmetic geometry
- Rational points on varieties and algebraic stacks
- Enumerative geometry over arithmetic ground fields
- Galois representations, lisse sheaves, and ramification theory

I also love to learn more about mathematical logic and representation theory.
