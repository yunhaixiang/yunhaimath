My interests mainly lie in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. Especially,

- Rational points
- Ramification theory
- \\(\mathbb A^1\\)-enumerative geometry
- Moduli spaces and stacks
- Galois representations

Outside my main interest, I'm curious about logic and foundations of mathematics.
