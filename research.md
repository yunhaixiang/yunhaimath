My interests mainly lie in number theory and arithmetic geometry. I am especially interested in topics of an algebraic flavor. Some topics I want to explore include

- Rational points
- Ramification theory
- \\(\mathbb A^1\\)-enumerative geometry
- Moduli spaces and stacks
- Galois representations

Outside my main interest, I'm curious about logic and foundations of mathematics.
