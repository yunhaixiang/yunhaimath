My research interests mainly lie in number theory, arithmetic geometry, and algebra. I also have  secondary interests in mathematical logic. More specifically, some topics I'm interested in are:

- Rational points
- Galois representations
- \\(\mathbb A^1\\)-enumerative geometry
- Ramification theory
- Moduli spaces and stacks
