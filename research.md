My main research interests lie in number theory, specifically arithmetic geometry. Outside my main interest, I'm curious about mathematical logic. Some topics I'm interested in are the following

- Rational points
- Ramification theory
- \\(\mathbb A^1\\)-enumerative geometry
- Moduli spaces and stacks
- Galois representations
