My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), he/him, and I also go by Daniel. I'm a graduate student in pure mathematics at Western University. I can be reached by [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). I have a math blog called [_The Singularity_](https://thesingularity.me){:target="_blank"}.

Outside math, I'm very curious, but not very knowledgable, about (analytic) philosophy. I also dabble in close-up magic, which is a hobby I've had since I was very young. In my free time, I enjoy reading, music, anime, films, video games, and strategy games. See more in [Miscellaneous](/miscellaneous).

This term I am organizing the Toric and Log Geometry Seminar at Western with Nicolas Rieke.

I'm an advocate for Kiran Kedlaya's "no social media" lifestyle. I try to minimize my unnecessary uses of social media, browsing or content-creating (though I still use some messaging functions). I feel that this is very beneficial for my mental health, and I highly recommend that you try the same.-->
