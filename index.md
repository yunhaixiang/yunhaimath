Hello! My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel. I'm a Ph.D. student in pure mathematics at University of Western Ontario. My advisor is Prof. Chris Hall. I am reachable via [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). I have a math blog called [_The Singularity_](https://thesingularity.me){:target="_blank"}. 

Outside math, I'm curious, but not very knowledgeable, about philosophy. I also dabble in close-up magic, which is a hobby I've had since I was young. In my free time, I enjoy reading, music, anime, films, and video games. See [Miscellaneous](/miscellaneous) for more.
