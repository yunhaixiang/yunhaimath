Hello! My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel. I'm a Ph.D. student in pure mathematics at University of Western Ontario. My advisor is Prof. Chris Hall. I can be reached by [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). Here is my [curriculum vitae](assets/CV.pdf).

Outside of math, I enjoy watching films and anime, playing single-player video games, listening to rock and classical music, learning and performing close-up magic tricks, reading literary and science fiction, and learning about history and philosophy.
