Hello! My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel informally. My pronouns are he/him. I will soon be a master student of pure math at the University of Western Ontario. I can be reached by [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). I have a math blog called [_The Singularity_](https://thesingularity.me){:target="_blank"}, where I write about math that I learned recently and more. My research interests primarily lie in [algebraic geometry](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebraic+geometry){:target="_blank"} and especially in topics of homological or homotopical flavors. For more detailed information, see my [Research](/research) page. 

Outside of mathematics, I love to learn about about many things, such as physics, computer science, and philosophy (though I'm not very knowledgable about any of them). I also dabble in [micromagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up_magic){:target="_blank"}. In my free time, I enjoy video games, anime, films, reading (especially scifi), music (especially classical), and strategy games (especially [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)){:target="_blank"}). I write more about these in [Miscellaneous](/miscellaneous).

I'm an advocate for Kiran Kedlaya's "no social media" lifestyle. I try to minimize my unnecessary uses of social media, browsing or content-creating (though I still use some messaging functions). I feel that this is very beneficial for my mental health, and I highly recommend that you try the same.-->
