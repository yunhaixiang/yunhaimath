Hello! My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel informally. My pronouns are he/him. I'm a graduate student of pure mathematics at the University of Western Ontario supervized by Prof. Ajneet Dhillon. I can be reached by [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). I have a math blog called [_The Singularity_](https://thesingularity.me){:target="_blank"}, where I write about math that I learned recently and more.

My research interests primarily lie at the interface of [algebraic geometry](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebraic+geometry){:target="_blank"} and [homotopy theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+theory){:target="_blank"}. For more information, see my [Research](/research) page. Outside of research, I am also broadly curious about many other topics in mathematics. One particular topic I'm very curious about is [homotopy type theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+type+theory){:target="_blank"}.

Outside of mathematics, I love to learn about about many things, such as physics, computer science, and philosophy (though I'm not very knowledgable about any of them). I also dabble in [micromagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up_magic){:target="_blank"}, which you can see more here. In my free time, I enjoy video games, music, anime, films, reading, and strategy games (such as [the game of Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)){:target="_blank"}). I write more about these in [Miscellaneous](/miscellaneous).

I'm an advocate for Kiran Kedlaya's "no social media" lifestyle. I try to minimize my unnecessary uses of social media, browsing or content-creating (though I still use some messaging functions). I feel that this is very beneficial for my mental health, and I highly recommend that you try the same.-->
