Hello! My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel. I'm a Ph.D. student in pure mathematics at University of Western Ontario. My advisor is Prof. Chris Hall. Previously, I completed my B.Math. in Pure Mathematics at University of Waterloo and M.Sc. in Mathematics at University of Western Ontario. I can be reached via [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). 

<!---I have a math blog called [_The Singularity_](https://thesingularity.me){:target="_blank"}. -->

Outside math, I'm curious, but not very knowledgeable, about philosophy. I also dabble in close-up magic, which is a hobby I've had since I was young. In my free time, I enjoy reading, anime, films, and video games
