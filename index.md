Hello! My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel. I'm a Ph.D. student in pure mathematics at University of Western Ontario. My advisor is Prof. Chris Hall. I can be reached by [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). Here is my [curriculum vitae](assets/CV.pdf).

Outside math, I dabble in close-up magic. In my free time, I enjoy anime, vintage films, single-player video games, science fiction novels, and learning about history, cultures, and philosophy.
