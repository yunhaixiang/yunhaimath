Hello! My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel informally. My pronouns are he/him. I will soon be a master student of pure math at the University of Western Ontario. I can be reached by [email](mailto:yxiang72@uwo.ca). I run a math blog called [_The Singularity_](https://thesingularity.me){:target="_blank"}. My research interests primarily lie in [algebraic geometry](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebraic+geometry){:target="_blank"}. For more details, see my [Research](/research) page. 

In my free time, I love to dabble in topics in math outside my research, as well as various topics in physics, computer science, and philosophy. I'm an amateur [close-up magician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up_magic){:target="_blank"}, and have been since I was 10. I love doing card tricks especially. I also enjoy video games, anime, films, reading (especially scifi), music (especially classical), and strategy games (especially [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)){:target="_blank"}). See more in [Miscellaneous](/miscellaneous).

I'm an advocate for Kiran Kedlaya's "no social media" lifestyle. I try to minimize my unnecessary uses of social media, browsing or content-creating (though I still use some messaging functions). I feel that this is very beneficial for my mental health, and I highly recommend that you try the same.-->
